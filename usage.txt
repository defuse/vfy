You must specify original and backup folders.
Usage: vfy.rb [options] <original> <backup>
    -v, --verbose                    Print what is being done
    -m, --machine                    Output summary in machine-readable format
    -f, --[no-]follow                Follow symlinks
    -x, --one-filesystem             Stay on one file system (in <original>)
    -i, --ignore DIR                 Don't process DIR
    -s, --samples COUNT              Comparison sample count (default: 0)
    -a, --all                        Compare entire file contents using BLAKE3
    -h, --help                       Display this screen

Log messages:

- "DEBUG: " When --verbose is enabled, shows each directory being compared.
- "DEBUG: " When --verbose is given twice, also shows each file being compared. With --all it should print the file hashes as well
- "EXTRA-FILE: " when an extra file is detected in the backup directory.
- "EXTRA-DIR: " when an extra directory is detected in the backup directory.
- "MISSING-FILE: " when a file is in the original but missing from the backup
- "DIFFERENT-FILE [reason]: " when a file is in the original but is different in the backup. This could be due either to size difference (SIZE), random sample difference (SAMPLE), or hash comparison difference (HASH). Multiple reasons can be given, e.g. if the size is different and the hash is different (with --all enabled) it would be "DIFFERENT-FILE [SIZE, HASH]:"

SUMMARY:
    Original items processed: 2090260 <-- total items (files+dirs) in original
    Backup items processed: 2090260 <-- total items (files+dirs) in backup
    Missing/different: 10 (0.00%) <-- total missing+different files, as ratio over total original items; if a directory is missing, all missing files inside are recursively counted
    Extras: 0 <-- total extra files+dirs in the backup (recursively counts entire directories that are extra)
    Similarities: 2090250 <-- total matching files+dirs in both original and backup
    Skipped: 8
